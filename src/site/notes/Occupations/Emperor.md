The **Emperors** are unique individuals within the Labyrinthum who possess the exclusive ability to control the indestructible walls that define its structure. Their powers allow them to guide the walls, create new passages, and dissipate existing ones. This capability is integral to the maintenance and potential reconfiguration of the Labyrinthum's levels and regions. However, manipulating the walls is extraordinarily exhausting and can lead to regional inconsistencies, which is why Emperors seldom use their powers to alter the overall shape of levels and regions.

## Origin and Succession

### Gideon Payne: The First Emperor

The sequence of Emperors began with **[[Significant Figures/Gideon Payne\|Gideon Payne]]**, the initial Emperor who emerged during the First Growth—the catastrophic event that followed the emergence of the Labyrinthum. Gideon Payne was the first survivor of the cataclysm and the first individual to be blessed by the mysterious cube brought back by the **Legacy-1** mission. Unlike other survivors, Gideon did not develop the ordinary _Labyrinthian Legacy_ powers. Instead, from the very beginning, he was endowed with the unique ability to control the walls of the Labyrinthum.

### Selection Process

The selection of a new Emperor occurs upon the death of the current one. Successors are chosen from among the **[[Occupations/The Followers\|Followers]]**, a narrow circle of people trusted by the Emperor. The order of succession follows the synodic periods of the planets, specifically:

1. **Mercury**
2. **Venus**
3. **Mars**
4. **Jupiter**
5. **Saturn**
6. **Uranus**
7. **Neptune**

This planetary sequence dictates the order in which new Emperors are selected, starting from Mars, as initiated by Gideon Payne.

## Powers and Limitations

### Control Over the Walls

Emperors have the unparalleled ability to manipulate the walls of the Labyrinthum:

- **Guiding the Walls**: Directing the movement and formation of walls within the labyrinth.
- **Creating New Walls**: Generating additional walls to alter configurations.
- **Dissipating Walls**: Removing existing walls to create new pathways.

### Limitations

- **Physical Exhaustion**: Manipulating the walls is unimaginably exhausting, even for an Emperor.
- **Regional Inconsistencies**: Alterations can lead to unintended consequences, causing instability within levels and regions.
- **No Labyrinthian Legacy Powers**: Upon becoming an Emperor—or in Gideon Payne's case, from the very beginning—individuals do not possess the standard magical abilities of other inhabitants. Their power is solely focused on controlling the walls.

## Influence on the Labyrinthum

While Emperors possess the ability to reshape the Labyrinthum, they exercise restraint due to potential negative impacts:

- **Maintenance of Stability**: Ensuring the structural integrity and balance of the Labyrinthum.
- **Minimal Intervention**: Avoiding unnecessary changes to prevent regional inconsistencies.
- **Crisis Management**: Utilizing their powers primarily during emergencies that threaten the Labyrinthum's equilibrium.

## The Followers

The **Followers** are a narrow circle of people trusted by the Emperor. They play a crucial role in the Emperor's life and the succession process:

- **Trusted Advisors**: Providing counsel and support to the Emperor, assisting in decision-making and governance.
- **Candidates for Succession**: Upon the Emperor's death, the next Emperor is chosen from among the Followers, following the planetary order.
- **Guardians of Knowledge**: Preserving the traditions and secrets associated with the control of the Labyrinthum's walls.

## Planetary Succession and Symbolism

The use of planetary synodic periods in the succession process holds significant symbolic meaning:

- **Cosmic Alignment**: Reflects a belief in universal order and the connection between celestial bodies and the Labyrinthum.
- **Historical Significance**: Ties back to Gideon Payne's initiation as the first Emperor associated with Mars.

## Cultural and Societal Impact

### Leadership Role

Emperors serve as pivotal figures within Labyrinthum society:

- **Guardianship**: Acting as protectors of the Labyrinthum's structure and the people within it.
- **Moral Authority**: Upholding principles that ensure harmony and balance.
- **Symbol of Unity**: Representing the collective well-being over individual power.

### Sacrifice and Service

- **Personal Sacrifice**: Foregoing (or in Gideon's case, never possessing) personal magical abilities for the greater good.
- **Dedication to Duty**: Emperors dedicate their lives to maintaining the stability of the Labyrinthum, often at great personal cost.

## Relationship with the Labyrinthian Legacy

- **Distinct Role**: Emperors do not possess the standard Labyrinthian Legacy powers that other inhabitants have. Their abilities are exclusively focused on wall control.
- **Balance of Powers**: The Emperor's unique role complements the abilities of others, maintaining equilibrium within the Labyrinthum.
- **Interdependence**: While Emperors manage the structure, other inhabitants use their magical abilities to thrive within it.

## Challenges

- **Physical Toll**: The immense strain of manipulating the walls can affect the Emperor's health and longevity.
- **Ethical Decisions**: Balancing the needs of different regions and levels when considering any alterations.
- **Isolation**: The unique nature of their powers and responsibilities can lead to a sense of isolation, relying heavily on the trust and support of the Followers.
